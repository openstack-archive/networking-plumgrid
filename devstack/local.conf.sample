# Sample ``local.conf`` for user-configurable variables in ``stack.sh``

# NOTE: Copy this file to the root ``devstack`` directory for it to
# work properly.

# ``local.conf`` is a user-maintained setings file that is sourced from ``stackrc``.
# This gives it the ability to override any variables set in ``stackrc``.
# Also, most of the settings in ``stack.sh`` are written to only be set if no
# value has already been set; this lets ``local.conf`` effectively override the
# default values.

# This is a collection of some of the settings we have found to be useful
# in our DevStack development environments. Additional settings are described
# in http://devstack.org/local.conf.html
# These should be considered as samples and are unsupported DevStack code.

# The ``localrc`` section replaces the old ``localrc`` configuration file.
# Note that if ``localrc`` is present it will be used in favor of this section.

# Minimal Contents
# ----------------
# While ``stack.sh`` is happy to run without ``localrc``, devlife is better when
# there are a few minimal variables set:

# If the ``SERVICE_TOKEN`` and ``*_PASSWORD`` variables are not set
# here you will be prompted to enter values for them by ``stack.sh``
# and they will be added to ``local.conf``.
SERVICE_TOKEN=azertytoken
ADMIN_PASSWORD=nomoresecrete
MYSQL_PASSWORD=stackdb
RABBIT_PASSWORD=stackqueue
SERVICE_PASSWORD=$ADMIN_PASSWORD

# ``HOST_IP`` should be set manually for best results if the NIC configuration
# of the host is unusual, i.e. ``eth1`` has the default route but ``eth0`` is the
# public interface.  It is auto-detected in ``stack.sh`` but often is indeterminate
# on later runs due to the IP moving from an Ethernet interface to a bridge on
# the host. Setting it here also makes it available for ``openrc`` to include
# when setting ``OS_AUTH_URL``.
# ``HOST_IP`` is not set by default.
#HOST_IP=w.x.y.z


# Logging
# -------

# By default ``stack.sh`` output only goes to the terminal where it runs.  It can
# be configured to additionally log to a file by setting ``LOGFILE`` to the full
# path of the destination log file.  A timestamp will be appended to the given name.
LOGFILE=$DEST/logs/stack.sh.log

# Old log files are automatically removed after 7 days to keep things neat.  Change
# the number of days by setting ``LOGDAYS``.
LOGDAYS=2

# Nova logs will be colorized if ``SYSLOG`` is not set; turn this off by setting
# ``LOG_COLOR`` false.
#LOG_COLOR=False


# Using milestone-proposed branches
# ---------------------------------

# Uncomment these to grab the milestone-proposed branches from the repos:
#CINDER_BRANCH=milestone-proposed
#GLANCE_BRANCH=milestone-proposed
#HORIZON_BRANCH=milestone-proposed
#KEYSTONE_BRANCH=milestone-proposed
#KEYSTONECLIENT_BRANCH=milestone-proposed
#NOVA_BRANCH=milestone-proposed
#NOVACLIENT_BRANCH=milestone-proposed
#NEUTRON_BRANCH=milestone-proposed
#SWIFT_BRANCH=milestone-proposed


# Swift
# -----

# Swift is now used as the back-end for the S3-like object store. If Nova's
# objectstore (``n-obj`` in ``ENABLED_SERVICES``) is enabled, it will NOT
# run if Swift is enabled. Setting the hash value is required and you will
# be prompted for it if Swift is enabled so just set it to something already:
SWIFT_HASH=66a3d6b56c1f479c8b4e70ab5c2000f5

# For development purposes the default of 3 replicas is usually not required.
# Set this to 1 to save some resources:
SWIFT_REPLICAS=1

# The data for Swift is stored by default in (``$DEST/data/swift``),
# or (``$DATA_DIR/swift``) if ``DATA_DIR`` has been set, and can be
# moved by setting ``SWIFT_DATA_DIR``. The directory will be created
# if it does not exist.
SWIFT_DATA_DIR=$DEST/data
